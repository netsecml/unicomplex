# How to obtain a million UNI coins

1.) Download and install Phantom App - https://phantom.app/ This is basically like Metamask, but specifically designed for the Solana network.

2.) Setting up an address in Phantom to recieve UNI.
- Click on manage token list
- Click on the + (add custom token)
- Fill in the three fields with the following information:
-- Mint Address: 7dUsXacYdQ8p3YGYXGvtuwprGAbFLfzkLnkiZLv51vLf
-- Name: Unicomplex Coin
-- Symbol: UNI
- Then click add. This may cost a fraction of a cent, so make sure your Phantom account has a tiny bit of Solana in it.

3.) Click on the UNI Coin token and then select, "deposit". This will give you an address you can copy. 

4.) Follow our official Twitter account: https://twitter.com/unicomplexcoin , DM or send us your wallet address and we will send you a million UNI coins.
